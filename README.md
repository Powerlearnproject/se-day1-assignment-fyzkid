#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.  Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.
  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The key milestones in the evolution of software engineering are:
1. The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C).
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of software development life cycle are:
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 Waterfall methoology uses a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. On the other hand; Agile methodology uses an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Devoloper: Write clean, efficient code; debug and resolve software issues; collaborate with team members to develop features; contribute to software design and architecture.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Design and execute test plans; identify and report bugs; collaborate with developers to resolve defects; perform regression testing and verify fixes.
Project Manager: Define project scope, goals, and deliverables; manage timelines, budgets, and resources; communicate with stakeholders; ensure the project aligns with business objectives and is delivered on time.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): These are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): These are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers challenges are:
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
  - 
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges include:
1. Agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks
2. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Types of testing: 
 - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Tell me about technology"
Improved version: "Explain the key differences between cloud computing and traditional on-premise IT infrastructure."


The improvement ensures that the response will be focused, relevant, and informative, directly addressing the user's needs.
